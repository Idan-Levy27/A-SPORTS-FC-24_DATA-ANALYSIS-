FIFA is one of the most popular videogames that get released every year, and from the season 2023/24 it has been officially renamed to EA Sports FC 24 due to lack of FIFA license.

The purpose of this notebook is to analyse the FIFA players dataset available at Kaggle, which provide information regarding players such as age, overall and potential attributes, club and league name, positions, and many others from the latest 10 editions of FIFA (from the 15th to the 24th).
