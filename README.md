FIFA is one of the most popular videogames released every year, and from the season 2023/24 it has been officially renamed to EA Sports FC 24 due to lack of FIFA license.

The purpose of this notebook is to analyze the FIFA players dataset available at Kaggle, which provides information regarding players such as age, overall and potential attributes, club and league name, positions, and many others from the latest 10 editions of FIFA (from the 15th to the 24th).


Guideline Questions I want to check:
* Do the height and weight columns have the appropriate data types?
* Should I separate the player tags and transform them into dummy variables?

EDA Questions:
* Preferred Foot Distribution
* Who are the best 11 players in the dataset?

The 1M💲 Question:
* Messi or Ronaldo? Who is the 🐐?

🔨 Tools:
* Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation
* Dummy variables
* Plotly and Seaborn for data visualization 📊
